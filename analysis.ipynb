      "This was a great conversation. I enjoyed it. Your guest is very knowledgeable and I appreciated your ability as an interviewer to listen objectively. My only critique comes early in the conversation during the Putin vs the West timestamp. The United States does have some publicly noted history in attempting to destabilize perceived enemy nations and install pro-western regimes, especially if those regimes have a lot of assets to be acquired the biggest being oil, and utilize it to our gain. Even if everything Stephen says is true about western Europe and United States being very welcoming to Russia throughout the years it does not change the fact that Putin is aware of the West's previous tactics in other countries. This coupled with his own training in ideological subversion, and economic warfare when he was an officer with the KGB it would no doubt make for a very heightened and suspicious individual who is aware Russia posses a lot of assets to be gained by west Europe and The United States, and he has seen we are not above destabilizing a country and leaving it's citizen's in shambles as a means to our own gain. This is by no means a support for Putin or the horrors of autocracy. However I think it needs to be noted because without all the nuances the bigger picture cannot be objectively and precisely formed. If the United States wants larger countries that posses a potential superpower risk such as Russia or China to become our allies then we need to prove we are universally trustworthy.\n",
      "edit: \n",

It is not highlighted in the Western news how aggressively they acted. Also Ukrainian soldiers 8 years have been shooting Donbass (their own citizens). Not that angelic. Did you know that Organization of United Nations came to Donbass and reported there were not Russians? Basically Ukrainian army has been shooting their own people. Okay, they have a right. It’s their own country. From my perspective it is amoral but again, they can do it, why not. Now, you have a neighbor whose president before Feb 24 came to Europe, shook a hand with the American representative and claimed that they would be in NATO and start developing a nuclear weapon.

While he had at least some political power and did not take money from the West Russian law enforcement was very lenient, to the point of letting him go on probation when a western company filed a lawsuit because he defrauded them when he was a lawyer. But once he started to effectively work for US Dept of State, his credibility was shot even among his staunchest supporters. I'm not even going to bring up his Nazi past (although you can look it up if you'd like). The way the rest of his team behaves now makes me even more sure that withdrawing my support of their organization was the right decision. They are openly anti-Russian now.

The formally oppressed predictably follow in the footsteps of the former oppressors.

The nonsense analogy of a woman being raped because of how she was dressed, the list of treaties that Russia was an inheritor of...  It's very puzzling how people who claim to be objective let their bias come right through.  When listing the agreements that Russia supposedly inherited after USSR, Dr. Kotkin completely ignores the 2 Minsk agreements that were sponsored by Germany and France, after which Ukraine comfortably did nothing and continued killing civilians in Donbass.  He conveniently forgets public promises given to Yeltsin by western leaders about non expansion of Nato to the East, that were blithely ignored.  He ignores public statements of western officials (prior to the war) that the whole \"Raison d'Etre\" for the Ukraine that was born in 2014 is weakening of Russia.  What you see happening on the battlefield now, where the west gives Ukraine old soviet junk to fight the russians with and encouraging to fight to the last ukrainian.  I won't even talk about the history of endless wars and invasions that US has with it's neighbors to the south.   Now, this was a democracy imposing itself on Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama...  Again -- totally fascinating that the democratic peace-loving America is allowed to practice the Monroe doctrine while Russia is somehow bound to be held by order that was imposed on it by the west.

      "You have to squint to the point of blindness not to see that America is using Nato to funnel Americas proxy war. The flat out refusal for meaningful peace talks etc, just fans the flames of war and hatred, leading to the already apparent ethnonationalism, evidenced by the new pursuit of claiming Ukrainians are Indo-aryans.\n",

So with China today, and so different from Great Britain in the 19th century and the USA since the 20th century!   In the late Ming,  China turned inwards from external trade, much to its regret when it became a victim of the west.

Theres a reason law is segregated into different spheres/sections and it is not applied equally in every section, let alone every nation. The whole point of realpolitik and realism is that nations do not act on moral principles but on geopolitical and material interests. And that those nations will sometimes go to extreme lengths to justify those actions and/or what they consider to be vital interests. This is what Mearsheimer and Stone are saying, not that there shouldn't be a moral discussion about how nations act, simply that there is no such (or that it is secondary) discussion when nations form their politics that guard their national interests.\n",

Moreover you cannot but laugh the argumentation of the red \"skirted woman\", while referring to the Iraq war and US perpetrated wars as \"mess\". Also as a historian he should be aware of the Monroe doctrine, which literally makes each country in the American continent a lady being anytime victim by having red skirt. Not to mention the all time bullying of countries that doesn't want to conform US interests. I mean this guy has really a distorted view about US wars, where if the US decides on a political expansion it is a \"mess\" created by a faction of the US, which is not the US's crime somehow, but if any other country does it it is criminal. Sure the latter is true and should be applied to either Russia or the US or any other country.

He is demanding but people in Hungary  don't forget his actions against their own people... Hungarians are just as proud of their heritage as other countries in Europe. This war will weaken  Europe badly, perhaps there is a reason they will not fulfill his demands after all!

      "Great interview. Thanks for these thoughts. What strikes though me is how Stephen depicts people in power as making emotion-based decisions - french desiring to be diplomatic superpower, usa trying to agree, russians feeling resentment. Also, expressing one person's statements as justification for the country's actions. I mean, just because Trump reached out to Putin, doesnt mean the entire US agreed with that. Trump or Biden doesnt reflect the entire US establishment. Putin also doesnt reflect the entire Russian government. Each country has many competing internal forces. I was hoping to more names, dates, quotes, and factual comparisons. All these ideas about \"blackening the image\", fighting the evil, \"good/bad guys\", \"freedom and unfreedom\", \"privacy of their own mind\", \"we are gonna punish\", \"to hell with this\" - this is not about history as a research subject. Too many broad concepts and generalisations. Presidents globally aren't some infants. I mean, Stephen is a historian. Can we hear chronology? Or a historian just for the title? Metaphors are relevant, no doubt. But still empty in terms of factual analysis. Stephen seems to use mostly cultural and worldview clash as a key lens in the interview. Also, seems to connect points really superficially and eventually say \"we have to be careful about definitive judgements\".\n",
      "word:  signed\n",
      "I listened to the interview with Oliver Stone first and was a bit startled about Oliver's stance because he basically suggested that Putin was right to start this war. But, he never really did, because he never talked about the actual conflict, just all that, in his mind, led up to it. Now, I have met Oliver once on a film project (his film \"Alexander\" which I was happy to not have signed onto for obvious reasons\", and it was a bit of a surreal experience because Oliver is so inherently anti-American in his view of the \"establishment\" of his country. So, how objective can he actually be in regards to the US's decades-long engagement of Putin?\n",
      "Now, listening to Kotkin, I am hearing a lot more rational thinking without an inherent prior bias. Even to the point where he states something that is so obvious: In America, you can criticize those in power for their decisions (which Stone loves to do) but in Putin's Russia, you might very well not see the light of another day if you do so. \n",
      "Of course, Oliver could never come to his conclusion (that people in the West have the freedom to speak their mind, even when it comes to their own government) because it would undermine a tremendous aspect of his self-perception: That he's one of the few American filmmakers to continually criticize his countries government and this fact alone makes whatever he creates so much more special than the work of other US filmmakers. It is his brand. But hey. Anyone can do it. But most filmmakers just find it too boring and a senseless exercise. \n",
      "On the other hand, Kotkin really strings it out in a way that is logical, makes sense, seems to track incredibly well with historical document. He's not a filmmaker. He a political analyst. \n",
      "Stone is just a filmmaker and has done his better work in fiction... embellishing and shaping his very personal take on historical moments. Fine ... but, in this particular instance, I prefer to listen to someone who clearly understands the narrative as it has played out and doesn't just want to bash the part of the US government in the last 40+ years relating to Russia. \n",
      "Heck, I am originally German, have worked in Russia on several occasions and still have some contacts there. I never perceive that the Russians I had contact with were fans of Putin, they just endured the fact that they lived under a dictator as long as they could go about their business of working in the film industry. \n",
      "That's all gone now and many are leaving the country. Putin is trying to \"make Russia great again\" and drag it back 40+ years into the past. As Trump tried with the US. \n",
      "I am happy to see that they are both failing and I hope it stays this way. \n",
      "My best wishes go out to the Ukrainian people, they are fighting a war that is for all of Europe, and I think that is being realized, along with the resulting food crisis. \n",

      "This is the second time that I hear the great knock-out Kotkin mention Gandhi once in a lecture, out of the blue, and now in an interview, nobody forcing it upon him neither-, with kinda of a slightly and rapidly supressed admiration. I would be most grateful to you, Mr. Fridman, if on a third round with Stephen Kotkin -please don't let him long of the hook, who else do we have to turn to for insight in this seemingly cursed epoch?-, you could see fit to ask kim about Gandhi and non-violence as a national \"security policy\" in a geopolitical context populated with the national-grandeur-womanising \"leaders\" of sorts you happened to dwell upon in this podcast. Somewhere i feel Mr.Kotkin thinks well of Gandhi as an alternative nationbuilder even if he could not build an alternative nation at all in the always final realist end. He seemed to have stood for nothing Kotkin argues at length (in other videos on the tube) to deem necessary to create a nation that could acquire a free influence sphere, i.e. all the multiple powers America makes Russia so envious about, all the heavy hardware stuff, besides the values that is. Gandhi wanted nothing of that for modern India, and apart from the very profound Swadeshi-economy-ideal the spinningwheel and its kadhi stood for as a multivalent symbol, he appeared to barely tolerate steamtrains beside the much admired Singer sowing machine. And I think he would have had nothing to do with nowaday things that are called Stinger (missiles etc), not even considering the longrun national security interest of India. Nehru did not follow him in that, and could not make do with Gandhis wisdom after the British rolled out and he had to fight-modernise wholesale for India's place in the sun among the non-aligned countries pressed hard between the two cold-war blocks. So what is non-violence as an integral spiritual political nation building program (and not just a possibly useful -given that the British were after all, all in all good sports decolonisation strategy) worth in Stephen Kotkin well armed prudential world...? Gandhi was definitely thinking about economy, peace, ecology, sustainability avant-la-lettre in all their interactions and all kinds of important public issues we face and he was in no way a mere fakir in a loincloth (Churchill) pulling some uncanny tricks on the white man. So what was he, and what might he still be now in our age for Kotkin's penetrating gaze? I close my eyes and I can hear Kotkin come up with a resignated \"Ah Gandhi, shame that...\"-statement. \n",
      "Could the new whole of a world grounded in wisdom old as the mountains Gandhi always stood for and realistically pretended India to follow him along in, and which he did not get from his follower-devotional-Bapudhji callers, could this integral Gandhi for some realistic but in its reasonableness unsuspected consideration on the part of Kotkin not have induced this, his \"shame that\"- kinda statement I think I hear from his lips? I would like a man that can measure a perduring abyss (Stalin), have measure the durableness of a mountain like the Mahatma...\n",

And this is where the west misunderstood Afghanistan.  Their religion rules over everything else.  Democracy, education, wealth, freedom, prosperity takes a back seat.  The people in Afghanistan have been brainwashed for hundreds and hundreds of years by their religion and it isn't modernizing or evolving in any substantive way.  I just don't see any country that is so dominated by their beliefs this way to be able to develop a modern democracy.

On war crimes , not so long ago , ICC was threatened by the same powerful institutionalised nation for arrest if cases against their soldiers were put to trial. Overall still interesting to hear . War is inhuman. This war is transforming slowly into a NATO versus Russsia & eventually the scale of destruction both actual and potential will force all nations of the world to take side, & that's WWIII.A solvable complex problem turned into a non sensical ELT .

      "Kotkin mentions, as an example, the 1948 Soviet coup against democratic Czechoslovakia.  \"Are you okay with that!?\"  He doesn't mention the US intervention in Italy's elections that same year.  Nor the overthrow of democratic Syria, the next:  A coup that started the crisis Syria has been in ever since.  \"We are okay with that.\"  Nor the coup against democratic Iran a couple of year later, which ended hope in that country and started it on its tragic slide.  Czechoslovakia, by comparison, got off easy.\n",
      "He says that fact that we can talk about our crimes in coffee shops without getting arrested shows that we are better and more liberal societies.  An yet, none of our criminals have been prosecuted.  Our nations have not faced any consequence.  Of the three, it is only Russia that has had to pay any price for its actions.  Only Russia has been repeatedly sanctioned, boycotted, and de-platformed.  Only Russia has had its citizens banned and harrassed, their property seized, and their contracts cancelled.  When did the US or Israel ever experience any justice like that?\n",
      "He calls NATO a defensive alliance.  But since 1990, with Yugoslavia, it has involved itself in one military intervention after another.  Interventions that have grown increasingly aggressive because of something he ascribes to Putin:  Learned impunity.  And yet, it is Russia that must be made an example and held accountable -- even to the point of the destruction and subjugation of their nation.  No punishment is too harsh.  Carthage must be destroyed!\n",
      "Finally, he lays out, with approval, the prospect of Israel attacking Iran because Iran might get nuclear weapons which might pose a threat to Israel.  He doesn't realize that he is describing the next Ukraine.  A nation engaging in activities which are wholly within its sovereign rights but which are nevertheless perceived to be a possible threat to a neighbor.  This time a \"neighbor\" 1000 miles away.  Compare this to Russia, which, rightly or wrongly, is intervening right next door.  In lands populated by consanguines who were being persecuted and killed -- not in error, but as a matter of policy -- by the government in Kiev.\n",
      "At this point, whether Russia was right or wrong to invade Ukraine is irrelevant.  What should concern us is the crime of intensifying and prolonging a conflict that should have already ended.  The war is being perpetuated for the vainglory of Zelenskyy, his party, and their cynical supporters in the West -- none of whose motives are not honorable.  It does the Ukrainian people and their nation no good -- either in the short term or the long term.  Only peace can do that.  It is the present and future that we should be concerned about -- and the future that we should be seeking to preserve.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"When a war doesn't go well it looks like lunacy\". Is this the \"Putin is crazy\" argument disguised as a pretentious sentence so you can get to the obvious conclusion yourself? Does he mean that the war is not going well so we can conclude that Putin is a lunatic? Note that the next sentence says that no wars go well...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"War never goes according to plan\". So he says that all wars go wrong, and therefore we must always assume that the aggressor is crazy? (According to his previous statement).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All wars are based on miscalculations\". Why does he say that? I guess that there are no perfect wars, but no plans are perfect anyway (military and non military). I think that he wants the listener to think that this war is wrong, without giving better arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The problem is not the miscalculation, it's the failure to adjust (like a GPS)\". So we should have arrived to the conclusion that this war is wrong (all wars are supposedly wrong anyway), and therefore an adjustment must be made. What is that adjustment? I guess that Stephen wants us to get to the conclusion that the adjustment is basically stopping the attack.\n",

But calling Ukraine a Democracy when Victoria Nuland decide that Jazenjuk is the guy to become primeminister is just a bad joke! At least in Austria they try to act like a Parlament and avoid fistfights there!\n",

Oliver Stone cant fathom the senseless wars and death perpetrated by the US war machine blinding him to what pain and death Russia has also caused and Kotkin cant fathom the wars and loss of life perpetrated by Russia's war machine blinding him to the exact same on the US side. I agree that i prefer to live in a hawkish democratic country than a hawkish autocratic country, but one big fault does not excuse a lesser one, they are both at fault. Peace most come from us taking power to the individual and rendering the centralized power capability of making such decisions of war not possible. I mean render the government less needed and vital, give more resources to individual people, let them make their own decisions and leave central power much less resourceful, cause they aint using those resources to help any of you anyway, anywhere.\n",

When questioned, under oath,  by U.S. Senator, Marco Rubio about the existence of those labs., Biden's advisor to the  Secretary of Defense, Victoria Nuland said, \"We are very concerned about  what Russia will do should they gain control of those Labs\" .    Rubio conveniently ended the questioning without asking her to answer directly that those Labs do exist. Nevertheless, she had admitted by expressing concern over Russia gaining control.

      "Oliver Stone is absent of knowledge that nuclear meltdowns are deadly.  We had a roommate from Romania who was about School age when Chernobyl blew up. It was horrifying to hear about their experience. None of him or his sisters were ever able to have kids. Three Mile island produced cancers. It was known years ago that there was an increase in cancers afterward, and according to the documentary we watched on Netflix, I think it was, people surrounding the plants, and people who were in the in the direction the wind blew, got cancers. Fukushima is an utter human and environmental disaster.  Fish in our Pacific Ocean are contaminated with radiation from the Japanese releasing their coolant water into the ocean. We lived about 1,000 feet from shore in Oregon and we and others we knew in Astoria, got burning skin from the radiation. They knew how long it would take the wind to get it over the ocean to the US. Please don’t tell me nuclear plants are safe.\n",
      "word:  confront\n",
      "I suggest Mr. Stone to confront his view of the situation in Donbas in 2014 with Mr. Girkin / Strielkov's interview given to Mr. Gordon. It can be inspiring.\n",
      "word:  charge\n",
      "10:09 one died at Fukushima    \"in 2018, the Japanese government recognized the death of one Fukushima plant worker to be attributable to radiation exposure, disbursing compensation to his family. The worker, a man in his 50s who had spent nearly 29 years working at nuclear stations in Japan until September 2015, was in charge of measuring radiation at the Fukushima plant. In the period of December 2011 and September 2015, the amount of radiation he was exposed to more than doubled from roughly 34 millisieverts to around 74 millisieverts, as the Japanese newspaper Mainichi reported. The maximum level of radiation exposure workers should be exposed to is 100 millisieverts every five years—an annual exposure to that level of radiation is linked to an increase in cancer risk. The worker was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2016 and died of the disease.\"  source  - forbes\n",
      "word:  documentary\n",
      "It was disappointing to not hear the word 'Thorium' when discussing the future of energy production by way of nuclear fission.  One would think that a documentary covering this subject would at least broach the subject.  Can \"walk-away-safe\" thorium molten salt reactors be made the technology of the future? Perhaps. Oak Ridge National Lab ran one successfully in the 1960s.\n",
      "If as much effort is put into such a project as there was to develop light water breeder reactors that produce plutonium used in nuclear weapons, then it could be possible.  Since the future of humanity hangs in the balance, it's worth a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other issue with light water reactors is the fuel.  Uranium is nowhere near as available in the earth's crust as thorium.\n",
      "Uranium like many other metals is getting more difficult to find and exploit profitably.  Having 10000 reactors in the world rather than the present 200, imagine the fuel requirements AND storage of the radioactive waste for thousands of years.  Thorium does not have this issue.  The 'low' death toll for nuclear energy was cited.  But the consequential damage of radioactive elements pouring into the Pacific Ocean to this day at Fukushima was not addressed. Again, thorium energy would not have this issue.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stone says 'methane' like it's a dirty word.  Methane is the primary gas that comes from gas wells.  It is mixed with other gases like ethane, propane, butane and their derivatives.  These other gases are separated at source and used for the manufacture of petrochemicals.  Example... ethane is cracked to ethylene and polymerized to polyethylene.  A useful material in today's world.\n",
      "\n",
      "When methane is burned, it produces carbon dioxide and water vapour.  Although methane is a more potent 'greenhouse gas' than carbon dioxide, it does not persist in the atmosphere.  Carbon dioxide is plant food and not as much of a contributor to global climate as is the sun.\n",
      "Now, if thorium nuclear energy can displace the combustion of natural gas (aka methane, CH4) then this methane can be put to better use... Natural gas is a key source of fertilizers in the form of ammonia and urea.  What is not to like about this re-orienting of priorities?\n",

Have I missed some podcasts? .. Or do  these folks not deign to interview with you?  Do you try to court them in any fashion?

      "Amazing interview Lex! you ask such good questions and I really like how you let people say what they have to say. The hypothetical interview with Hitler was fascinating too, it gave me a better comprehension of why Oliver proceeds in the way that he does with his films. I like the fact that he gave both Bush and Putin a chance to speak, it shows an astounding level of openness in what he will talk about and with who. I did find him to be too pro Putin and anti Ukraine/ the west but it is a refreshing take on the situation at the same time too. The western propaganda machine has censored Russia too much, I would like to hear the propaganda from all sides, it helps me to realize that it is all propaganda\n",

      "As a computer science student myself I am learning that pressure, confusion, and mistakes are when I have my best moments of learning. By trying to create something and finding out why it is not working is almost a relief when  you find the error. I hated tech and computers in my teenage years, went back to college in my mid 20s , and the stuff I understand about programming and systems and data now, i would never of guessed I could learn it. I think what Mr. Stone is saying here is, while your young, learn as much as you can about everything, to make it a part of your life. To keep learning everyday is a blessing we have the ability to use.\n",

      "word:  glaring\n",
      "The two biggest glaring things that popped out at me regarding Stone's views in this interview is 1) his casual portrayal of Putin as having \"defended\" Russia against Chechnya and Georgia. The invasion of Chechnya for example was justified based on a false flag attack and it was needlessly annexed by Russia, and ironically the Russo-Georgian war has a LOT of parallels with the current Russo-Ukrainian war. 2) his claim that Hitler showed some sort of a kindness to England by not invading them; in reality, ALL of his generals knew and told him in no uncertain terms that an invasion of England was absolutely not logistically possible. The D-Day invasion itself was almost impossible, and it depended on YEARS of massive American industrial output, whereas Germany couldn't have even handled the construction of just the landing craft that the Allies used.\n",

Možnost se na něčem domluvit, opravdu si navzájem rozumět a potom podle toho také dále v aspoň střednědobém horizontu (a je nutné uvažovat v dlouhodobém horizontu v řádu několika generací) konzistentně jednat je u lidí tristně nízká. Zjednoduším to, pokud v USA každý demokratický prezident zavede opatření a uzavře mezinárodní dohody týkající se ochrany klimatu a udržitelného rozvoje a každý republikánský prezident je zase zruší nebo výrazně omezí, tak to nemusí dělat vůbec, ušetří tím čas, peníze a energii minimálně za ty first class letenky na konference.\n",

      "This was a great interview & helped me realize having a conversation regarding Russia’s side of this war with anyone in Oliver Stone’s generation will be a challenge as they have been raised with the idea that U.S is the good guy and Russia is evil. I’m Not saying they haven’t done some evil things but our hands are nowhere near clean. So If you  care about the people of Ukraine and you support the war, then you are a proxy-moron. Oliver said so much of my thoughts from watching an interview of Putin in 2019. Again not saying he’s great, I’m saying he seems more level-headed than the monster the U.S wants us to believe he is. That’s all. But on another note is Lex single ? lol - asking for a friend 😜\n",
      "word:  state\n",
      "38:00 Some would argue that Yeltsin put Putin in charge because of state secrets and that Putin showed disrespect to Yeltsin from the very first day he handed power over to him when Yeltsin was calling him to congratulate him and all Putin could say was he would call him back (which he never did.) \n",

      "Bill Clinton warned Yeltsin that Putin would be a danger to democracy (and it was during a visit by Putin to the White House where Clinton was eying him over and wondering where he stood on positions,) which initially Yeltsin brushed off but in the last years of his life came to express agreement with.\n",

V roce 1948 zaplatili poslední splátku hypotéky, kterou si na to vzali a někdy kolem roku 1952 byla dílna uzamčena a přeměněna na jakýsi sklad a to až do počátku sedmdesátých let. Vyrůstal jsem v prostředí silné averze vůči komunistům, SSSR a celému východnímu bloku a strachu z téhož.

      "word:  benefit\n",
      "I disagree with Mr. Stone's view on methane. Methane is the first compound in the methane series and benefits greatly by the formula for the methane series. That formula is CnH2n +2.  This gives methane a unique boost from the +2 part of the equation. Two water molecules are produced by every reaction between the oxygen supplied by the air with each methane molecule. This +2 bonus quickly disappears as the methane series climbs to the heavier molecules in that series approaching, in the limit,  one water molecule. The heat produced is directly related to the heat of fusion of this water. Methane leaking from abandoned oil wells is a definite problem as Mr. Stone is correct in its global warming effect. If it is burned, the only reaction products are water and carbon dioxide.\n",

Check it out and comments.He allowed himself to be conned. Many people I’ve found to be gullible that I once respected. The information is often not wrong just grossly incomplete and biased. You could tell by a person’s one sided use of adjectives. Stone’s mind is made up.  That said, I wish someone Stone respected would challenge him.

Technologie pro získávání a uchovávání energie z obnovitelných zdrojů stále nemohou ani zdaleka a především konzistetně pokrýt rostoucí spotřebu el. energie. V kombinaci s rozvojem elektromobility domnívám se hrozí v některých státech EU kolaps celé rozvodné sítě. Ideální je dle mého názoru fúzní reaktor, nejsem schopen odhadnout jak daleko je ke spuštění rentabilního provzu,ale již před více než dvaceti lety se odhadovalo tak padesát let. Záměrné odstřelování a terorizace obsluhy některých jaderných elektráren na Ukrajině navíc ukazuje vysokou úroveň zabezpečení současných štěpných jaderných reaktorů. Nevím jestli tak už neučinili,ale dle mého názoru by Německo rozhodně mělo znovu spustit odstavené elektrárny a to minimálně do té doby, než najde jinou náhradu než je ruský plyna a ropa a české Dukovany a Temelín.\n",

      "1:24:40 I would like to discuss the Budapest Memorandum of December 5, 1994, which the distinguished Mr. O Stone does not bring up by pressing the nuclear weapons pedal, as if Ukraine (still) had such an arsenal, Mr. Stone, passing in silence over this treaty; the fact that Russia is the one that does not recognize and does not respect this treaty, like many other treaties (still) in force. In fact, Russia is positioning itself on a strategy of reconsidering all political and territorial establishments in Europe with a single purpose: as long as it promotes and supports a policy of denial of political bases and territorial treaties between European countries, it creates the context to put in question the stability of any region by free will. In other words: \"The Russian state does not recognize this status quo, so it claims its right to act accordingly.\" Europe itself, each region has been the subject of countless wars throughout history, countless empires have forcibly encompassed entire nations (Balkans, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire, Greece, Cyprus, Crimea, Baltic countries, Poland, Prussia ...). So I'm quite disappointed in Mr. Lex Friedman that he's not asking Mr. O Stone the questions. From my point of view, the dialectic that Mr. Stone \"adopts\" (in fact, I allow myself the freedom to say \"borrow\") is that of reversal of roles: the aggressor is in fact the victim. The aggressor, in fact, is not so detestable, because he may have had some motive to carry out his actions, because, isn't it, Mr. Stone, the victim could have been guilty as well. I understand that Mr. Friedman is in a deep admiration for his guest (and I would be so), but I think the right questions better put certain situations in context.\n",

He made some gross generalisation suggestion that the Ukrainean army is a far right extremist movement in a miserable attempt to discredit them while also suggesting that those war crimes that the Russian army commited are not what we think they are.

He'll talk to people, on campuses for example, because he can follow up once or twice over the following weeks or months, having left his acquaintances to think on their own time for a while. It's incredible to see the long, silent pause in the conversation with Magnabosco, as they start to honestly ask themselves things that no debate or graph or consensus had yet been able to incite. He lets them know that he's recording, so we get to benefit from seeing people as they realize (for example) they've been clinging to ideas and beliefs, willfully ignoring overwhelming contrary evidence and / or a complete lack of any supporting... simply because they heard it from a trusted adult when they were little, or because they've reached a very brittle comfort from avoiding harsh realities of human life. These people can stop pursuing ideas and actions that are damaging our world and each other. They're better equipped to build a solid picture of their existence through unflinching analysis of their experiences, and evaluating those of others. They're left with an improved ability to handle hardships or conflicting ideas, as mere concepts or questions are no longer able to wreck a worldview they've created around baseless core beliefs. \n",

Soldiers heald tales, of how they'd have a better life as a US military prisoner than they would if they continued fighting for their own country. So notoriously cushy were the conditions of imprisoned enemy soldiers (again, relatively so), it inspired those soldiers to at least strongly consider surrender to American forces when going got tough and morale was low. Those famous post-war Soviet defections would never have naken place if the defectors thought they'd be worked or starved to death, between beatings.

While Oliver Stone does an admirable job at reaching out for the truth from his particular angle he does fall into the same traps of deductive reasoning as the voices he criticizes, i.e. he makes fundamental assumptions about the imperialist nature of the US and then deduces that certain policies must be examples of those policies. Example, he contests that the Western media portrays Russia and Putin as synonymous and as singular bodies. In his characterization of US foreign policy as quasi-imperialist, he describes the United States in pretty much the same kind of homogenous and singular body, when in fact power structures in a country like the US are inherently more multidimensional as they appear to be in an autocratically-run state such as Russia. In other words, his arguments are driven primarily by ideology to which he then arranges his interpretation of events.\n",

In the very beginning of the war i was totally and absolutely against it. Also i never voted Putin, coz of his inner politics. Still my heart is aching and I deeply regret about all the poor civil people who's suffering. But deep research of the roots of the conflict and this topic in general (what's important i don't have TV at all for many years and as historian i used neither Russian nor Ukrainian sources to avoid prejudgement, but only foreign independent sources, eng., french, italian etc.) bit by bit changed my mind... maybe unfortunately... but now I can't ignore all that i saw... all of this is purely invented political game against Russia and Russians for many many decades... And poor Ukraine was just an exchanging coin in this mean game... Zelensky became president, coz promised to establish peace with Russia, but who ever allowed him to do it? Anyway I hope it will end soon... Ukrainians I consider as brothers no matter what... I want them to become free of US agenda, and to find their true independence... coz the west never truly cared about them as they never cared about us... And now after all those tear-squeezing slogans, they already limited the support for the Ukrainian refugees...  No free transport, no free of charge staying in hotels, even no entrance to shops in Poland for ex.. Where's all that promises for Ukrainians to be admitted in Nato they so much hoped for?...

      "Oliver Stone's inability to express the truth that multiple things can be true at the same time is disheartening and disappointing. He is stuck in the 1960s counter cultural mindset. As in all things: there are arguments that contextualize Russian foreign policy and Putin's actions as something other than a cartoonish foil to the West. However, Oliver choses instead to go the opposite:  naively venerating Putin as some cartoon man: a mystic warrior monk of the Russian people, using Russian propaganda to cite his claims. \n",

      "Ironically, Oliver cites George Orwell's novel 1984 multiple times in his attack on Western Media all the while through the interview he uses the same big brother obfuscation to dither from speaking to Russian policy as it actually exists, but instead on what he wants it - and the Russian state - wants it be presented as. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite Olivers long dithering to defend Russia, all he had to say was Putin is fighting for Russian interests within a specific historical and cultural context. Russia has a view and a destiny outside of the west which he wants to enact. Some of these interests involve delusions, greed, desire for power etc. The United States also has interests some of these interests involve delusions, greed, desire for power etc. The difference is he clearly could not contain his loathing for the United States as a country or as a power, and he could not contain his joy at propping up a false representation of the current social, economic, and foreign policy of Russian power. \n",

There is a long history of Russia when \"normalizing\" the situation with blood and weapons  in its influence zone (like in Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968,  Poland in 1981). No question the USA is forcing its \"theory\" on a strong - many times on a violent - way I've never backed consider that aggression as well.\n",
      "I think that statement \"Putin isn't a communist\" is a mistake as well. Independently what kind of a \"library\" is behind them on the wall to point to (I mean books written by Lenin, Marx or Engels alternatively  Nietzsche's  or Hitler's)  these \"rulers\" are exerting their power on the same way following the same theory - \"stay in power\".  \n",

MLK, Mother Teresa, Gandhi, etc. Those who demonstrate unconditional love for all are the gurus and sages, the \"illuminated\" ones. Yet it is within all of us, hidden and dormant. We can love the purity that everyone has or is, while at the same time abhorring the cruelties that others perpetuate. It is not impossible at all to reach this state, to fully open one's heart, to just be love.\n",

We are the ego, but we are also a part of the tree of life, and our branch is humanity.\n",

Certainly I'm not siding with Putin, who is clearly an evil man, but I think it is healthy to understand all the facts and question how the West might be influencing our opinions.  Particular great example when he discusses NATO and how these European countries joining NATO lose a bit of sovereignty, with US putting military bases and nuclear weapons on their land.  He is right, they are basically tied to what the US wants in conflicts.  I don't agree however that Putin went to war because the US told their allies he would.  The US started warning its allies when Russia put hundreds of thousands of troops on the border, which was cause for alarm.  Putin didn't have to do that, and ultimately he didn't have to invade, it was a choice.  Putin's biggest mistake is under-estimating how costly and inefficient it will be to occupy the Ukraine after it invades.  If you destroy all the infrastructure, how are you capitalizing on the invasion?  It would take years to organize and take advantage of the natural resources, and by then, the West has completely isolated Russia.\n",

And, Mr Stone wouldn’t be surprised by the reaction of people in Europe to the invasion, had he been born and lived in Europe. Apocalypse Now, in my opinion, is the best movie ever made, but O.

      "@nuclear power or rather decarbonization - the coal may be a different but oil and gas do not get used in energy only but serve also as a chemicals in certain technological processes that are crucial for us and difficult to replace. As for methane - there are deposits which will be released if temp. raises and we can use that to burn. Once burnt there is no methane but (assuming effecting oxidation of clean gas) we get co2 and h2o and heat. That is it. You could use the nuclear and to lesser extent so called renewables to produce synthetic fuels from CO2 that would be best as the bateries and H2 as energy storage are really bad which in case of H2 is not going to improve due to physics of it and in case of bateries it is going to end up with physical limitations too just the physics and chemistry are more complex and there is always hope to get it better). But this is another discussion altogether.  The point is that nuclear is not the end of it. We need follow up tech not because of the greens and climate but because the hydrocarbons are also limited so at some point it will be necessary. The nuclear with the currently most popular technology (water pressureised) is just a dead end. There are others that seem to beeasier to get into passive safety as well as burning more of the fuel that the current ones do leaving less waste in a pocess too.\n",
      "word:  lack\n",
      "The extreme lack of historical knowledge needed to buy what Oliver Stone is selling regarding Putin is hilarious. I watched his documentary and the historical section is frankly comedy for me to watch, i.e convieniently not mentioning how the holodomor made Ukrainians despise Russia (which explains why some joined the Nazis once they came onto their land). Another example is how the molotov ribentropp pact was not described as a Soviet-German pact but some kind of \"European\" pact. It's absolutely laughable how generously it portrays the Soviets then, and thus Russia now, since Putin is trying to rewrite history for his own propaganda purposes. If you believe what Oliver has to say about Putin it's a wonder you didn't walk into traffic while growing up - you give the word moron a new meaning.\n",
      "word:  version\n",
      "Writing from France: I used to watch the French version of RT (Russia Today) which struck me as generally very good and never felt like just a Russian propaganda mouth-piece. It presented an alternative point of view, often more nuanced than MSM. I was shocked that it was suddenly pulled on the say-so of a just a few voices somewhere within the EU power structure. There are still some alternative French sources that present a much more balanced view on the war in Ukraine, notably Xavier Moreau on STRATPOL who spent 15 years in Russia and has many contacts in both Russia and Ukraine. The French mainstream news is no better than the US mainstream in that they have a set narrative to push (whether they believe it or not) lest they be seen an apologists for Putin.\n",
      "word:  situation\n",
      "I appreciate this podcast for providing a different viewpoint on the ongoing situation.\n",
      "What I do feel is that it may have helped a bit more to start at a bit lower level and then move up. \n",
      "With this I mean that Oliver Stone mentions things like a nazi regime in Ukraine, Russia being defensive and not imperialistic and the United States being threatening towards Russia. \n",
      "\n",
      "While I do see that, as a European getting only second-hand information from news sources and the internet, my perception on this conflict is biased, some of these elements make it hard for me to follow his arguments or views, as I cannot comprehend the concepts they are based upon. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, when mentioning Ukraine aggression in the Eastern regions from 2014-2022 as something that is missed by the western media, I can sort of see that, however I feel this can be seen largely in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Obviously a sovereign country that is under active invasion will display aggression in order to defend itself. \n",
      "This brings me to the mention of Russia not being imperialistic; from recent memory (keep in mind I'm in my 20s and thus only somewhat familiar with the 21st century events), Russia has been the only country that has been invading other countries (be it Georgia or twice Ukraine now). To me there is no place and should be no tolerance world wide for invading another country in the 21st century, so I cannot understand how the facts of these invasions can be aligned with the statement of Russia not being imperialistic. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would love to see more coverage of these initial concepts such that I can have a better understanding of them later on, especially since this is the very first time in my life where I am encountering a situation where I just cannot grasp the goodness on the other side and that scares me, as there should be. However in my current belief, one cannot justify invading another country nor assimilating any territory of another country, furthermore I have never sensed any desire from anyone in the west to invade Russia (imperialism is not of this age anymore and we'd much rather work together), so these ideas that NATO is threatening Russia are strange to me as the entire point of NATO seems to be to prevent situations like this where Russia is consciously continuously deciding to cause pain, suffering and death to thousands of ordinary civilians. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I feel like I am rambling which I do not want to do, as I don't feel like bringing up my whole perspective is very useful in this comment section. Instead I hope that you can provide more content like this, as I think it's very useful, however maybe make sure that concepts on which controversial arguments are built are better explored at the start. Which I can also understand may be hard to do, as everyone's level of understanding is at a different place so it's hard to find a good starting point. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, great podcast, thanks again for the content Lex. \n",
      "I hope this comment is not seen in any negative light towards anyone within the podcasts or anyone's world view who may be reading this. I wanted to share a bit of my current understanding to show how some concepts argued may be too big a leap for me to understand from where I am at, which makes it hard for me to fully understand some the rest.\n",

The much greater danger and devastating threat is to the bio-sphere. Fukushima's continuing disaster for example threatens the entire  northern  Pacific ocean basin. Mines tailings just as Chernobyl become wastelands. Consequently, no Mr. Stone I do not agree with you nor do I agree with Patrick Moore who is no longer associated with Greenpeace.

      "by Christelle Neant.\n",
      " On May 27, 2022, we were in Svetlodarsk, just days after the takeover of the city by Russian forces and those of the People's Militia of the LPR (Lugansk People's Republic).  The inhabitants told us about the eight years under the yoke of Ukraine, and the crimes (thefts and rapes) committed by the Ukrainian soldiers against the civilian population.\n",
      " Before arriving in town, we pass by the former positions of the Ukrainian army, in front of Debaltsevo.  We find a lot of waste there, including a large number of syringes that suggest that the Ukrainian soldiers took drugs.  A guess that will be confirmed by the residents of Svetlodarsk.  A lady tells us how in the middle of a discussion, an obviously drugged Ukrainian soldier suddenly took out a knife and started to cut through the air with it, in a trance.\n",
      " In the center of Svetlodarsk, near the shops, we find a large number of locals, who have a lot to tell about the crimes of Ukrainian soldiers and the complicity of the OSCE.  There are so many people who want to tell us what they have experienced, seen and heard, that the interview is difficult.  Everyone absolutely wants to tell such and such a fact, which seems important to him, even if it means cutting off the person who is speaking.\n",
      " Unanimously, all the inhabitants met said they were happy to have seen the arrival of the Russian army and the people's militia of the LPR.  When I report to them the accusations of war crimes that the Ukrainian and Western media are peddling against Russian soldiers, they all respond in unison that they are lies.  The population of Svetlodarsk has nothing to reproach the Russian soldiers or those of the LPR.\n",
      " On the other hand, it is not the same with those of the Ukrainian army.  The inhabitants of Svetlodarsk tell us for almost an hour about the robberies and rapes committed by Ukrainian soldiers.\n",
      " As soon as they arrived in Svetlodarsk in 2014, Ukrainian soldiers stole rings, chains, and even Christian crosses.  They also stole metal gates, plasma televisions, furniture, doors, electrical outlets, and many other things, which they then sent home through the \"new post\" office.\n",
      " And the Ukrainian soldiers not only robbed the residents of Svetlodarsk, they also raped young women and girls.  One of the women interviewed, Praskovia, tells us how, in 2018, Ukrainian soldiers drove away and raped her who is now her stepdaughter, when she was only 16 years old.  Luckily they find her quickly, and alive.\n",
      " Another woman, Natalia, recounts how they robbed the cigarette and vodka section of the store where she worked, gun in hand, before stealing the jewelery of the young woman who worked in this section, Irina, then raping her.\n",
      " Natalia, and her friend Viktoria, also tell us how Ukrainian soldiers landed in a house where there was an invalid woman in bed, and her daughter who was taking care of her.  They raped the young girl in front of her mother, before killing her.\n",
      " Praskovia also told us that the Right Sector fighters had organized a real delivery system for young women.  They were caught in town, then taken by car to their headquarters, where they were raped.\n",
      "This testimony reminds me of that of Natacha, a survivor of a Right Sector prison.  She had told us how Ukrainian fighters raped prisoners in chains.\n",
      " In addition to robbing and raping, Ukrainian soldiers killed civilians, never being charged for these crimes.  So a Ukrainian tank literally drove over a car in which there was a family.  The four occupants, including two children, died instantly.\n",
      " Residents of Svetlodarsk also told us how Ukrainian soldiers were shelling them, or each other, with the complicity of the OSCE, which then declared that the shots came from Gorlovka, when the direction of origin of the shells was  totally inconsistent with this assertion.\n",
      " The OSCE, which also turned a blind eye to the heavy weapon fire conducted from the Ukrainian soldiers' base, where we found four holes for howitzers and self-propelled guns and numerous shell casings proving that these artillery pieces had fired since that  location, which is close to the observers office!  However, Svetlodarsk was in the zone of withdrawal of heavy weapons provided for by the Minsk agreements.\n",
      "Evidence of OSCE complicity in Ukrainian military crimes mounts: organization employees transmitting location data of People's Militia units, satellite phone bearing their logo found in Azovstal  , and the discovery of software in the computers of Ukrainian soldiers allowing them to control the surveillance cameras installed by the organization on the front line.\n",
      "It will be difficult after all this to make people believe that the OSCE was a neutral organization, which faithfully reported violations of the ceasefire in Donbass.  This organization turned a blind eye for eight years to the violations of the Minsk agreements by Ukrainian soldiers, just as the West turned a blind eye to the crimes committed by these same soldiers against the population of Donbass.\n",

      "This interviewer is naive and overlooking what is happening on the ground daily on film even in Ukraine.  CRUX on Yutube from Indian, where the tradition of free critical press is still respected, and they remain neutral on Ukraine,  they say that  so many have been tortured and murdered in the basement of a law enforcement building--untold huge numbers.   Ukraine is not \"Americanizing\" the violence against its people and civilians and sovereignty.   I have run into very convincing sociopaths in working with people the courts take an interest in and they lie with such ease and joviality...and some can remember their lies and use lies strategically or just for their entertainment.  And I have seen good lawyers I thought were moral (not sure) but they lied easily and changed quickly when the object of their charm went out the door.  A totally new person sat before me with totally different views.  Charm can totally deceive and this interviewer is totally naive and strikes me that way.  My opinion is based on doing many interviews myself...and it is hard to verify what they say especially if it is historical.\n",
      "word:  Lex\n",
      "It's refreshing to hear Lex interviews with somewhat controversal characters. When Stone said controversal things, i was always waiting for push-back (as expected frm other media) - but Lex keeps calm, and just keeps asking to understand the reasoning. Not judgemental, but allowing for his audience to get the full thought process of the interviewee. The audience can judge. Thanks for that. I would have loved to hear Lex interviewing some of the dubious and controversal historic figures, politicians, dictators and generals. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\n",
