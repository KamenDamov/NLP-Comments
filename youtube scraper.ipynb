Minimalist studio, no distractions, interesting guests, calm delivery of thoughtful questions.  Lex is definitely filling a space that needs to be filled.  Well done', 'It took me 11 hours to do the math but he said “Lex” more than any other guest combined ', 'I love Stephen Kotkin. One of my fav historians, he should be much more widely known.', 'This interview was a certified classic!', 'One of my favorite guests you’ve had on previously. Looking forward to listening to this one. Thanks for the great content, Lex.', 'What an excellent interview. What fine people! Thank you for sharing your expertise and analysis, and something of yourselves.', \"Having an interview with Stephen Kotkin and Oliver Stone to discuss Russia in such a short time period is a major achievement. I'm not sure exactly how to put it, but it can't be understated just how much insight we received in such a short time period.\", 'I’m blown away with the compassion, depth and overwhelming insight this conversation brings to the table. What a masterpiece! Thank you so very much, Stephen and Lex! \\U0001fae1', 'I especially appreciated Dr. Kotkin’s take on how to live a purposeful life.  What an amazing scholar and human being.', 'Lex I’m so glad that you allowed Stephen the time to fully develop his arguments, and Stephen, thank you for the compassion and logic.', \"This is the 2nd time I listen to this pod cast and I am in awwww as to all the points covered in such an amazing way.    I want to read all of Steven's writings.\", \"This was a great conversation. I enjoyed it. Your guest is very knowledgeable and I appreciated your ability as an interviewer to listen objectively. My only critique comes early in the conversation during the Putin vs the West timestamp. The United States does have some publicly noted history in attempting to destabilize perceived enemy nations and install pro-western regimes, especially if those regimes have a lot of assets to be acquired the biggest being oil, and utilize it to our gain. Even if everything Stephen says is true about western Europe and United States being very welcoming to Russia throughout the years it does not change the fact that Putin is aware of the West's previous tactics in other countries. This coupled with his own training in ideological subversion, and economic warfare when he was an officer with the KGB it would no doubt make for a very heightened and suspicious individual who is aware Russia posses a lot of assets to be gained by west Europe and The United States, and he has seen we are not above destabilizing a country and leaving it's citizen's in shambles as a means to our own gain. This is by no means a support for Putin or the horrors of autocracy. However I think it needs to be noted because without all the nuances the bigger picture cannot be objectively and precisely formed. If the United States wants larger countries that posses a potential superpower risk such as Russia or China to become our allies then we need to prove we are universally trustworthy.\\nedit: \\nAnd overstaying our time in the middle east, while attempting a regime change in Iraq and then our hasty sloppy withdrawal from Afghanistan was not and is not a good universal look. Not to mention our dependency on the abuse of Asia's cheap labor force so that we can live privileged lives filled with inexpensive things. Let's always promote freedom and democracy but also do our best to look at the biggest picture possible when doing so, because if we don't our freedom might be coming at the cost of someone else's enslavement.\", 'As an 80 years old Dane living in Denmark on a small Island called Fejoe, I am trilled to listen to this interwiev. IT gives me an outwiev og the greater political situation. I am indeed thankful for this posibily.', 'What a relief listening to this after the Stone thing.\\nThx for the great podcast', 'Outstanding! Thank you Lex & Stephen ', 'I love listening to Stephen :-D Stuff happens.... That is priceless from a renowned professor. Nonetheless very true. Nobody has perfect information and the ability to process it.', 'I admire Stephen Kotkin so much.Lex you did a great job!x', '\"Lex\" - Most used word in this Podcast! - Amazing listen, thank you!', 'Thank you, Lex, for bringing Kotkin after Stone.', 'Having watched the Oli Stone interview, I have to say I really appreciate the diverse perspectives you have on the show, Lex.  Great stuff', 'Amazing interview, thank you for sharing!', 'Lex, you are a diamond in the rough.. Thank you for everything you do.', 'I enjoyed every minute of it! Just discovered Lex! Спасибо и блестяще!', 'Thanks for your work Lex!', 'This conversation is just fantastic. Thank you.', 'Heartfelt intro.  I feel but a piece of that tracing my ancestry that has history in both countries.  I lived in Moscow for a year and visited 3 weeks in Kiev.  I too have a heart for both and support your quest.  Godspeed Lex.', 'Thank you for putting out Stones and Kotkins interviews on this topic. Greetings from Germany!', 'Moving intro Lex and appreciate the balancing  view., lovely man, Mr Kotkin. Tread carefully on your travels Lex this world needs good souls and intellects like you. Stay safe!', 'What a fantastic, insightful and very well articulated interview!', 'Outstanding interview. Your podcast is second to none Lex. Keep up the great work.', 'Wow this guy is great! Such a good episode', 'Wow, I really enjoyed this podcast without realizing this is outside my immediate interests. Thanks Lex and Stephen!', 'Lex podcasts are great,  love the way he allows the guest to have a platform to speak, I only wish he would push back more against all arguments. It seems there are too many opinions interjected in these discussions that go unchallenged.', 'Take a drink every time Stephen says “Lex”. You’ll have a 2-day hangover.', \"Fascinating to hear after Stone. The objective vs. subjective view. It's interesting to imagine him talking about Russia when he mentions the United States, and vice versa.\", 'Great interview! I truly appreciated hearing this.', 'Very one-sided interview and he contradicts himself a lot. I dont know how you guys are saying this is the best interview ever', 'This is a very educational and great interview. No rush, good thoughts and positivity through the dialog. Thank you Lex and Stephen!', 'Very educational interview with a great mind. I listened to this interview twice. If nothing else Lex, you attract the greatest minds in western culture. You are learning too, keep up the good line up of guests for your interviews.', \"Me, a Chinese, listening to him talking about China at 1 AM in the morning. I've watched all your clips about China and communism\", 'One of the greatest minds in contemporary geo politics. First time ive listened to a 2 hour plus podcast from beginning to end.

I am a little smarter now.', 'Awesome view you keep expanding in amazing ways the picture gets more clarity with every interaction', 'Lex, thank you for this great interview.\\nYou will probably have no problem with your visit to Ukraine.', 'So this was really all about Lex Fridman.

Many heartfelt thanks.\", 'Came here from spotify to say this dude is based AF, great podcast!', \"I love how Lex brings people on to present both perspectives of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This was a fascinating podcast.\", 'Lex has surpassed Rogan in terms of interviewing', 'Downright incredible conversation. From just listening to Stephen, I know that his books are fantastic reads. His ability to explain complex geopolitical machinations (Putin’s calculations for continuing the war) was so clear and concise that a child could understand it.', 'I’m learning more and more about Russia ,22 years ago I met a Russian paleontologist who is a United States citizen, when I ask her about Russia back then all she said was not good. She left Russia and became a United States citizen before I met her.   This guy is saying everything I’ve been thinking and I just started watching the stuff but I seen it now .', 'Огромное спасибо!️\\u200d', 'Excellent interview.', 'I hope that Prof. Kotkin will soon be able to finish the 3. (final) Vol. of his excellent Stalin biography. A great scientist. Thank you!', 'Very intellectual guest which takes good points in history and can se hole view of world.', 'Get Victor Davis Hanson on the podcast, a classical historian would be very informative here and in general. I rate him on a par with Mr Kotkin, no disrespect implied at all. This is a superb episode.', 'Outstanding Interview Lex and incredibly insightful and informative. Keep up your amazing work', 'Thank you so much for your conversation!', \"Hi Lex! Really like your podcast and interesting guests. Joe Rogan's podcast used to be my favorite but nowadays he mostly has comics and fighters on which isn't nearly as interesting as the good ol' folks you're having on.

Bravo ', 'Fantastic interview, thank you both!', \"he's the perfect antidote\", 'Good job Mr Fridman', 'Wow! What an intro! Prayers up Lex! ️', '\"All war is based on miscalculation, but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation\"', 'I read both of his books on Stalin since the last podcast. Huge fan of Kotkin!', \"I've been wondering if Putin has a favorite Tsar. I'm hoping it's Alexander the first\", 'Great interview. Though Kotkin is even more fascinating to listen when speaking at his own pace from a podium.', 'One of the most informational podcasts I have ever listened to regarding Ukraine.

YOU are one my favorite human beings, despite not knowing you in person. Keep bringing light to the world.', 'You’re a light in this world allowed us to learn and explore.\\n', 'Great interview! Thank you for the enlightenment you have brought to me!', 'Sharing this excellent histrionic piece.', 'Essential follow up to the Oliver Stone interview. Thank you for the balance Lex and humility not to colour the experts’ voices.  Subsequently, I come away with the perspective that Stone’s assessment, whilst well-informed on a first-hand basis is, as a result, deeply biased and without historical foundation.', 'Excellent interview and the mutual respect is apparent. Well done and thank you!', 'Lex is delivering on educators that Joe lacks nowadays.  Keep it up!!!', 'Your fusion of humility, compassion and sensitivity is evolving the phenomena of podcast interviewing. It’s attuned to a global intellectual zeitgeist. Compulsive listening every time. \\n\\nThis interview is another treasure: nearly three hours of Kotkin’s acute analysis and insight.\\n\\nWe might not agree with everything he says but his knowledge imparted to us - for free - is priceless. The same can be said of many of your guests.\\n\\nLex, do not underestimate the contribution your podcasts are making across the globe. For this we are hugely appreciative. \\n\\nYour emotional investment in Ukraine - Russia is particularly heart-wrenching. We implore you to stay safe as you travel both countries, and we understand your desire to embark on this journey. Trust you will find what you’re searching for and give support to those you visit.\\n\\nUltimately, we look forward to your return, your insights and your continued expansion of our knowledge via your interviews. \\n\\nI write from Africa and end off with an ancient farewell that we say to a friend when departing: “Walk gently. Walk in peace.”', 'Oliver Stone is no expert...keep the experts coming', 'Watching and listening to \"Eli from Russia\" gives me a better understanding of life and happenings in Russia than this Kotkin guy.', 'Incredible interview - thanks Lex!', \"Mr. Kotlin's patience is also admirable, the way he gently, kindly corrects the flawed questions, the same way a loving father tries to educate his slightly idiotic son.\", 'Mr. Kotkin always has me riveted!', 'This introduction and ending brought me to tears. This was not just an insightful conversation with good historic information, but raw, courageous sense of impending potential uncertainty. Thanks for sharing this one Lex.', 'Thank you for your work! From Russia with love :)', 'Thank you . This was an incredible interview', 'That intro about Mr. Fridman traveling to Russia/Ukraine hits hard.', \"For a second I was worried he might not remember Lex's name.\", 'Kotkin seems totally unable to see the world from a global south perspective.', 'This was the best episode yet. As someone who enjoyed the original focus on machine learning it’s great to see this transcend into something so much more. Great job and amazing guest.', 'I need to start watching these interviews instead of just listening, this whole time I thought this was Joe Pesci!', 'Coming from the Oli Stone interview. Really nice to get both sides. Media tends to skew things and yet i get a sense i can trust Lex here.', '37:30 Agree with most of the podcast so far, except comparing the invasion to a woman in New York..', 'Really enjoyed this one even though the discussed topics were often very sad.', 'Again top class quality!!!!', \"Thanks for this. Love his first interview and I've been wanting to hear his thoughts on everything happening\", 'The loop of insanity may have been introduced in the middle but in the mind it has been extended prior the beginning and requires examination and resolve to exit the beaten path of humanity', \"What a fabulous interview.  I've been watching two years now, and catching up on old ones, this is one of the best I've seen. Stephen Kotkin just lays it all out and seemed to be spot on in almost everything he said.\", 'The first 10 minutes tell you everything you need to know about Russia.', 'I would be great to see Kotkin and Stone discussing these relevant political issues in one room and producing insights mediated by Lex. Two brilliant separate interviews regardless.', 'For me, more common sense that what Oliver Stone offered.', 'Great interview, I couldn’t agree more with everything he was saying to include the US in Iraq in 2003.

Referring back to 17th century would make every country a warmonger, especially since conflict was seen in a different light back then.

Here is how i\\'d put it. The USa and Russia are 2 persons with a long rivalry, and russia perceives that their rival is trying to pull/convince/turn Ukraine into a member of its group. Russia reacts wrongly by attacking Ukraine to chain her and prevent that (especially if you consider concepts like \"Russia cannot be a great power without Ukraine\").

Even spoke with Lex on clubhouse about this. First and for all, I condemn the invasion. Despite the fact that the analogy with a raped girl is sure pictorial but unfortunately not valid. Ukraine is not just a girl walking around. They are neighbors. And isn’t it conventional in our society that we are supposed to be at least in a friendly relationship with our neighbors? \\nDuring the last 8 years Ukraine has been banning Russian artists, comedians (with Ukrainian roots and relatives there). Let’s consider football games (before Feb 24,22) where Russian fans always supported Ukrainian teams (brother nation) and in the meantime Ukrainian fans were always aggressive towards Russians. It is not highlighted in the Western news how aggressively they acted. Also Ukrainian soldiers 8 years have been shooting Donbass (their own citizens). Not that angelic. Did you know that Organization of United Nations came to Donbass and reported there were not Russians? Basically Ukrainian army has been shooting their own people. Okay, they have a right. It’s their own country. From my perspective it is amoral but again, they can do it, why not. Now, you have a neighbor whose president before Feb 24 came to Europe, shook a hand with the American representative and claimed that they would be in NATO and start developing a nuclear weapon. The weapon which presumably they could use against Russians. Since they already showed their unfriendly initiatives during the last decade.\\n\\nTo sum up, I am not protecting Putin, as I mentioned of course it is his fault and it is terrible that we engaged in the war. It is a tragedy. However, the point of message was to show how the “raping” analogy is not helpful to understand what happened. \\n\\nPS For the sake of logic and good dialectic arguing, try not to use analogies because analogy doesn’t prove anything.

While he had at least some political power and did not take money from the West Russian law enforcement was very lenient, to the point of letting him go on probation when a western company filed a lawsuit because he defrauded them when he was a lawyer.

Was it right for the people who have died and will die because of it, hell no! \\n But NATO is not just a humble defense union of pacifist nations, it\\'s also a defender of Capitalism. And currently capitalism is posing an existential threat to whole humanity in a form of global warming.\\n As I see it, continuing this war and escalating is only in the interests of capitalists, especially those who specialize in war.\\n\\nAbout Russian invasion of Ukraine:\\nStrangely, in this section there wasn\\'t that much talk about the invasion.\\n I was born in USSR, but I grew up in the west. What I\\'ve seen is same type of thievery in the west and east alike. The only difference that I can see is that in Russia people are just more aware of it because the thievery and oppression is done more openly. \\n\\nAbout  Putin\\'s plan for the war:\\nIf you look at history, Russia has always sucked at offence :D newest attempt does not look any different. The only way Russia ever expanded, with any significance, was without a bloody conflict. \\nIn a way, it looks like Russia is trying to be like a very specific Western country, and failing miserably at it. Because Russia is just not playing to their strengths.\\n\\nTwitter is not an open world game where an indifferent party provides facilities for fair engagement, it\\'s a game where one opponent makes all the rules with impunity. I.o.w. for Russia that was an unwinnable battle to begin with.\\n\\nInterestingly, I have been thinking similarly that Putins invasion in Ukraine is not as simple of a thing as \"go kill ppl, because nazis live there too\". Imposing economical pressure on the West by means of a prolonged proxy war, could be one of his the actual goals...but it only works as long as West is using Ukraine as a proxy to test their new toys ...legally.\\n\\nWhy Ukraine? Well that just happens to be a country that cannot trigger a WW3 as soon as you attack em...\\n In a way Finland could have been Ukraine just as well, as we have neo nazis here too, just like in America also in power positions(according to tabloids of the past). I\\'m guessing that \"denazification\" is one of the reasons why Finland decided about NATO membership so quickly :D but seriously, there are better ways to deal with misguided people than a war.\\nAttack started to the west, and Russia had only two choices there, after a quick googlin I found out that there is only few differences that matter between two countries, Finland mainly exports machinery and shitting paper, while Ukraine exports food in significant enough quantities. Attack on Finland would simply not have same effect on the West, because people can live without Finnish machinery and shitting paper, but not without food...\\n\\n...hmmm this is starting to make sense.

So with China today, and so different from Great Britain in the 19th century and the USA since the 20th century!   In the late Ming,  China turned inwards from external trade, much to its regret when it became a victim of the west.

You could ask them how they feel they are represented in the mass media, ask them what they think of the big monopolies on farming, ask what they think about the future of farming, and if they feel they are well-represented or if they feel lobbyists for big corporations rule everything.. and what could be done to improve farming in America.

I could be wrong.\\n\\n2. I don't think the Russians ever intended to occupy Kiev. My understanding was they surrounded it, except to the west, to keep Ukrainian forces locked down and unavailable further east. Occupying a city of that size in the year 2022 would cost blood and bad optics, I don't see many modern armies wanting to do that. I could be wrong.\\n\\n3. In terms of institutional and monetary pressure, I am surprised to see the Ruble at higher prices than what it was against many major currencies than before the war. I think Kotkin is correct on some of the tech transfers and blocking of exports in the mid-term causing issues with the Russian economy though.

The whole point of realpolitik and realism is that nations do not act on moral principles but on geopolitical and material interests. And that those nations will sometimes go to extreme lengths to justify those actions and/or what they consider to be vital interests.

What strikes though me is how Stephen depicts people in power as making emotion-based decisions - french desiring to be diplomatic superpower, usa trying to agree, russians feeling resentment. Also, expressing one person\\'s statements as justification for the country\\'s actions. I mean, just because Trump reached out to Putin, doesnt mean the entire US agreed with that. Trump or Biden doesnt reflect the entire US establishment. Putin also doesnt reflect the entire Russian government. Each country has many competing internal forces. I was hoping to more names, dates, quotes, and factual comparisons. All these ideas about \"blackening the image\", fighting the evil, \"good/bad guys\", \"freedom and unfreedom\", \"privacy of their own mind\", \"we are gonna punish\", \"to hell with this\" - this is not about history as a research subject. Too many broad concepts and generalisations. Presidents globally aren\\'t some infants. I mean, Stephen is a historian. Can we hear chronology? Or a historian just for the title? Metaphors are relevant, no doubt. But still empty in terms of factual analysis. Stephen seems to use mostly cultural and worldview clash as a key lens in the interview.

But, he never really did, because he never talked about the actual conflict, just all that, in his mind, led up to it. Now, I have met Oliver once on a film project (his film \"Alexander\" which I was happy to not have signed onto for obvious reasons\", and it was a bit of a surreal experience because Oliver is so inherently anti-American in his view of the \"establishment\" of his country. So, how objective can he actually be in regards to the US\\'s decades-long engagement of Putin?\\nNow, listening to Kotkin, I am hearing a lot more rational thinking without an inherent prior bias. Even to the point where he states something that is so obvious: In America, you can criticize those in power for their decisions (which Stone loves to do) but in Putin\\'s Russia, you might very well not see the light of another day if you do so. \\nOf course, Oliver could never come to his conclusion (that people in the West have the freedom to speak their mind, even when it comes to their own government) because it would undermine a tremendous aspect of his self-perception: That he\\'s one of the few American filmmakers to continually criticize his countries government and this fact alone makes whatever he creates so much more special than the work of other US filmmakers. It is his brand. But hey. Anyone can do it. But most filmmakers just find it too boring and a senseless exercise. \\nOn the other hand, Kotkin really strings it out in a way that is logical, makes sense, seems to track incredibly well with historical document. He\\'s not a filmmaker. He a political analyst. \\nStone is just a filmmaker and has done his better work in fiction... embellishing and shaping his very personal take on historical moments. Fine ... but, in this particular instance, I prefer to listen to someone who clearly understands the narrative as it has played out and doesn\\'t just want to bash the part of the US government in the last 40+ years relating to Russia. \\nHeck, I am originally German, have worked in Russia on several occasions and still have some contacts there. I never perceive that the Russians I had contact with were fans of Putin, they just endured the fact that they lived under a dictator as long as they could go about their business of working in the film industry. \\nThat\\'s all gone now and many are leaving the country. Putin is trying to \"make Russia great again\" and drag it back 40+ years into the past. As Trump tried with the US. \\nI am happy to see that they are both failing and I hope it stays this way. \\nMy best wishes go out to the Ukrainian people, they are fighting a war that is for all of Europe, and I think that is being realized, along with the resulting food crisis. \\nSo, thumbs-up to Kotkin\\'s clear view of the world as it unfolds and a thumbs-down for Stone who can\\'t seem to crawl out of the foxhole from which he chooses to commentate as long as he can criticize the US establishment.', 'Lex, I have one big ask; bring on Alexander Dugin.

I would be most grateful to you, Mr. Fridman, if on a third round with Stephen Kotkin -please don\\'t let him long of the hook, who else do we have to turn to for insight in this seemingly cursed epoch?-, you could see fit to ask kim about Gandhi and non-violence as a national \"security policy\" in a geopolitical context populated with the national-grandeur-womanising \"leaders\" of sorts you happened to dwell upon in this podcast. Somewhere i feel Mr.Kotkin thinks well of Gandhi as an alternative nationbuilder even if he could not build an alternative nation at all in the always final realist end. He seemed to have stood for nothing Kotkin argues at length (in other videos on the tube) to deem necessary to create a nation that could acquire a free influence sphere, i.e. all the multiple powers America makes Russia so envious about, all the heavy hardware stuff, besides the values that is. Gandhi wanted nothing of that for modern India, and apart from the very profound Swadeshi-economy-ideal the spinningwheel and its kadhi stood for as a multivalent symbol, he appeared to barely tolerate steamtrains beside the much admired Singer sowing machine. And I think he would have had nothing to do with nowaday things that are called Stinger (missiles etc), not even considering the longrun national security interest of India. Nehru did not follow him in that, and could not make do with Gandhis wisdom after the British rolled out and he had to fight-modernise wholesale for India\\'s place in the sun among the non-aligned countries pressed hard between the two cold-war blocks. So what is non-violence as an integral spiritual political nation building program (and not just a possibly useful -given that the British were after all, all in all good sports decolonisation strategy) worth in Stephen Kotkin well armed prudential world...? Gandhi was definitely thinking about economy, peace, ecology, sustainability avant-la-lettre in all their interactions and all kinds of important public issues we face and he was in no way a mere fakir in a loincloth (Churchill) pulling some uncanny tricks on the white man. So what was he, and what might he still be now in our age for Kotkin\\'s penetrating gaze? I close my eyes and I can hear Kotkin come up with a resignated \"Ah Gandhi, shame that...\"-statement. \\nCould the new whole of a world grounded in wisdom old as the mountains Gandhi always stood for and realistically pretended India to follow him along in, and which he did not get from his follower-devotional-Bapudhji callers, could this integral Gandhi for some realistic but in its reasonableness unsuspected consideration on the part of Kotkin not have induced this, his \"shame that\"- kinda statement I think I hear from his lips?

What should concern us is the crime of intensifying and prolonging a conflict that should have already ended.  The war is being perpetuated for the vainglory of Zelenskyy, his party, and their cynical supporters in the West -- none of whose motives are not honorable.

Have Lavrov on or go to Moscow and interview Putin himself directly and show us a genuine conversation with the real arguments and counter arguments (and not these strawman arguments that your guest himself puts up and then tears down. Wtf is that, if not manipulation???).  This sh.. is so one sided, even I, a nobody, could counter half of what your guest said with facts and history and examples, off the top of my head. \\n\\nThe fate of our entire species hangs in the balance. So facts matter. The truth matters. Don\\'t you think that Russia, the largest nuclear superpower on Earth, deserves at the very least to state their claims and provide arguments and evidence in support of those claims? \\nIf not, then how do you ever expect to \"understand\" what is going on? Let alone find a solution. \\n\\nA lot is at risk. We are on a collison course with The East. CBDR! NUCLEAR this time.\\n\\nAnd no I\\'m not Russian, not even close.', 'Stephen Kotkin is brilliant, great conversation.\\nPlease get Victor Davis Hanson on the podcast.', 'This is an extremely politicized view , look at the examples Kotkin cites... they are emotional , subjective and omit key points ... This is the view of the US establishment. Stone has heart and soul ...who is telling the truth ? One seeks to inform freely , one seeks to influence, & manipulate.', 'War till the last Ukrainian! Good going, Kotkin', '40:56   A few minutes before that, the professor interpreted Russia\\'s move based on their practice in the past. From this moment on, he explains that the \"West\" has also sinned in the past. Lex did not ask the key thing - how to trust the \"West\" when he showed the world that he was behaving like a tyrant, for example when they lied about weapons of mass destruction. And many times.', 'The same Zelensky who thinks stephan bandera is a hero.', 'Is he speaking about Russia or the CIA?', 'Bold move traveling to Ukraine and Russia following these interviews, please by safe Lex.  It is indeed a dangerous trip since you are a recognizable public figure, wishing you safe travels brother.', 'If you are free, your friends the turning backs (Jack Fowles). If you see the true nature of humans (tribal primates) it is hard to subscribe to any tribe fully. Perhaps, if you feel like that, you are after all not alone. There are a lots of them and with time their numbers only increasing, as of course the regression from those who are unwilling to grow to full adulthood, and still think the sun rotates around their tribal camping ground during the great process of migrations, conquests and coming and goings of kingdoms, tribal federations and empires.  \\nNonetheless I hope you can visit both Russia and Ukraine in future and will be as welcome as the Americans are welcome in Vietnam today.', 'support  Lex   stay  strong', 'great episode! also suitable to balance out the nonsense Oliver Stone spoke about on your podcast last week.actually, I never heard of Kotkin before, but I am glad I encountered him and his broad and rich depth of knowledge today. very valuable and informative conversation.

Putin can and will use this to divide and conquer.', 'Great...as allways..tnx', \"Excellent; what a contrast between Stephen Kotkin and Oliver Stone's interviews, thoughtful and accurate analysis (Kotkin) versus vague innuendo (Stone)\", 'Dog food?  I thought zombies ate human flesh.', 'Its good to hear the perspectives of a Neo-con on Russia and the Ukraine invasion and understand how they arrived to their analysis. Diversity of views is why I keep coming back to your podcast. Thanks Lex.', \"I have to say Kotkin is MASSIVELY biased. it's very suspect how he speaks about things that are ahistorical and completely opinion in a way that makes it seem like fact. it's dangerous. Same thing he's warning about he's doing.\", 'I thought that this interview would give reasons why this war is wrong, other than the simplistic \"Putin is crazy\". But at 47:44 Stephen says a couple of things that disappointed me very much:\\n\\n\"When a war doesn\\'t go well it looks like lunacy\". Is this the \"Putin is crazy\" argument disguised as a pretentious sentence so you can get to the obvious conclusion yourself? Does he mean that the war is not going well so we can conclude that Putin is a lunatic? Note that the next sentence says that no wars go well...\\n\\n\"War never goes according to plan\". So he says that all wars go wrong, and therefore we must always assume that the aggressor is crazy? (According to his previous statement).\\n\\n\"All wars are based on miscalculations\". Why does he say that? I guess that there are no perfect wars, but no plans are perfect anyway (military and non military). I think that he wants the listener to think that this war is wrong, without giving better arguments.\\n\\n\"The problem is not the miscalculation, it\\'s the failure to adjust (like a GPS)\". So we should have arrived to the conclusion that this war is wrong (all wars are supposedly wrong anyway), and therefore an adjustment must be made. What is that adjustment? I guess that Stephen wants us to get to the conclusion that the adjustment is basically stopping the attack.\\n\\nFrankly disappointed. Stephen must be very proud of his empty and pretentious sentences. But I think that this is not the way to explain why this war is wrong.', 'Thanks for these interviews. \\nLove & prosperity to you all. ', 'Thank you Lex.

In my opinion he is a propagandist. Iam from Austria and its really hard for me to call Austria a Democacy when the Bundeskanzler who was never voted for in first place gets replaced within 1 Week by media and the next guy i dont even remember the name because he throw the towel within a few days (for sure it was not the paycheck he disliked)! But calling Ukraine a Democracy when Victoria Nuland decide that Jazenjuk is the guy to become primeminister is just a bad joke! At least in Austria they try to act like a Parlament and avoid fistfights there!\\nIf you watch the decisions from all european leaders to suport the civilwar vs eastukraine, you need to be a dickhead to still belive these are independent decisions!

Thank you for your work and your human commitment.\", 'Realpolitik amateur....', 'Once again Lex… you are impressive… such a wonderful humain being…!!!!!', 'Thank you for providing both perspectives', \"Oliver Stone comes from the perspective of hate towards USA's empire policies and Kotkin comes from the perspective of hate towards Russia's empire policies. Oliver Stone cant fathom the senseless wars and death perpetrated by the US war machine blinding him to what pain and death Russia has also caused and Kotkin cant fathom the wars and loss of life perpetrated by Russia's war machine blinding him to the exact same on the US side. I agree that i prefer to live in a hawkish democratic country than a hawkish autocratic country, but one big fault does not excuse a lesser one, they are both at fault. Peace most come from us taking power to the individual and rendering the centralized power capability of making such decisions of war not possible. I mean render the government less needed and vital, give more resources to individual people, let them make their own decisions and leave central power much less resourceful, cause they aint using those resources to help any of you anyway, anywhere.\", 'I am a huge fan of Stephen, such an amazing guest Lex!

Rubio conveniently ended the questioning without asking her to answer directly that those Labs do exist. Nevertheless, she had admitted by expressing concern over Russia gaining control.   Just the facts.  Let\\'s also discuss  the Cuba incident during J.F.K\\'s Administration.', 'Thank you for this. And also, thanks to COVID 19 you can wear a mask on your travels!

       " \"This was a great conversation. I enjoyed it. Your guest is very knowledgeable and I appreciated your ability as an interviewer to listen objectively. My only critique comes early in the conversation during the Putin vs the West timestamp. The United States does have some publicly noted history in attempting to destabilize perceived enemy nations and install pro-western regimes, especially if those regimes have a lot of assets to be acquired the biggest being oil, and utilize it to our gain. Even if everything Stephen says is true about western Europe and United States being very welcoming to Russia throughout the years it does not change the fact that Putin is aware of the West's previous tactics in other countries. This coupled with his own training in ideological subversion, and economic warfare when he was an officer with the KGB it would no doubt make for a very heightened and suspicious individual who is aware Russia posses a lot of assets to be gained by west Europe and The United States, and he has seen we are not above destabilizing a country and leaving it's citizen's in shambles as a means to our own gain. This is by no means a support for Putin or the horrors of autocracy. However I think it needs to be noted because without all the nuances the bigger picture cannot be objectively and precisely formed. If the United States wants larger countries that posses a potential superpower risk such as Russia or China to become our allies then we need to prove we are universally trustworthy.\\nedit: \\nAnd overstaying our time in the middle east, while attempting a regime change in Iraq and then our hasty sloppy withdrawal from Afghanistan was not and is not a good universal look. Not to mention our dependency on the abuse of Asia's cheap labor force so that we can live privileged lives filled with inexpensive things. Let's always promote freedom and democracy but also do our best to look at the biggest picture possible when doing so, because if we don't our freedom might be coming at the cost of someone else's enslavement.\",\n",

Referring to the right of every country to choose their own alliance is true and overall desirable, but the cuban missile crisis was a thing that the USA didn\\'t accept, nor would they accept an overall alliance of cuba with another power not aligned with them.\\n\\nThat does not make Putin\\'s invasion of Ukraine legitimate, but i feel his points are poor there. Here is how i\\'d put it. The USa and Russia are 2 persons with a long rivalry, and russia perceives that their rival is trying to pull/convince/turn Ukraine into a member of its group.

And isn’t it conventional in our society that we are supposed to be at least in a friendly relationship with our neighbors? \\nDuring the last 8 years Ukraine has been banning Russian artists, comedians (with Ukrainian roots and relatives there). Let’s consider football games (before Feb 24,22) where Russian fans always supported Ukrainian teams (brother nation) and in the meantime Ukrainian fans were always aggressive towards Russians. It is not highlighted in the Western news how aggressively they acted. Also Ukrainian soldiers 8 years have been shooting Donbass (their own citizens). Not that angelic. Did you know that Organization of United Nations came to Donbass and reported there were not Russians? Basically Ukrainian army has been shooting their own people. Okay, they have a right. It’s their own country. From my perspective it is amoral but again, they can do it, why not. Now, you have a neighbor whose president before Feb 24 came to Europe, shook a hand with the American representative and claimed that they would be in NATO and start developing a nuclear weapon. The weapon which presumably they could use against Russians. Since they already showed their unfriendly initiatives during the last decade.\\n\\nTo sum up, I am not protecting Putin, as I mentioned of course it is his fault and it is terrible that we engaged in the war. It is a tragedy. However, the point of message was to show how the “raping” analogy is not helpful to understand what happened. \\n\\nPS For the sake of logic and good dialectic arguing, try not to use analogies because analogy doesn’t prove anything.

Finnish \"advisory\" voting that manages to keep a political party in power for decades, while they do not need to keep any of the promises to the people? \\n- ...education funds being progressively cut since end days of cold war 1?\\n- What about so many protests I\\'ve never heard of on national news. Unless it\\'s protest against bad policy when there is a opportunity to blame the protesters?\\n- What about Political Transparency being one of the most wanted things in western world? \\nAre you OK with that? \\nand these are just from the top of my head... there are obviously more.\\n\\nThe more I listen to differing opinions the more I see west and east as the same coin, with a cloak on one side and dagger on the other...the less I want to live on this planet, where \"powers that be\" only want conflict because it seems that, that is the only state they understand how to rule, and if it works don\\'t touch.\\n\\nSorry for a shameless Plug: #OccupyKuiperBelt!\\n\\nAbout Response to Oliver Stone:\\nFirstly, Russia has had more women than men in population for a long while now, Raping is just not a part of the culture...yet that is what is used most often to demonize Russia nowadays. \\nThat said, I agree that Russia invading Ukraine, if it was purely on the basis of them trying to join NATO, was a bad move that Russia will pay for.\\nWas it right or wrong response to political shenanigans that was going on at the time, I\\'ll probably never know. Was it right for the people who have died and will die because of it, hell no! \\n But NATO is not just a humble defense union of pacifist nations, it\\'s also a defender of Capitalism. And currently capitalism is posing an existential threat to whole humanity in a form of global warming.\\n As I see it, continuing this war and escalating is only in the interests of capitalists, especially those who specialize in war.\\n\\nAbout Russian invasion of Ukraine:\\nStrangely, in this section there wasn\\'t that much talk about the invasion.\\n I was born in USSR, but I grew up in the west. What I\\'ve seen is same type of thievery in the west and east alike. The only difference that I can see is that in Russia people are just more aware of it because the thievery and oppression is done more openly. \\n\\nAbout  Putin\\'s plan for the war:\\nIf you look at history, Russia has always sucked at offence :D newest attempt does not look any different. The only way Russia ever expanded, with any significance, was without a bloody conflict. \\nIn a way, it looks like Russia is trying to be like a very specific Western country, and failing miserably at it. Because Russia is just not playing to their strengths.\\n\\nTwitter is not an open world game where an indifferent party provides facilities for fair engagement, it\\'s a game where one opponent makes all the rules with impunity. I.o.w. for Russia that was an unwinnable battle to begin with.\\n\\nInterestingly, I have been thinking similarly that Putins invasion in Ukraine is not as simple of a thing as \"go kill ppl, because nazis live there too\". Imposing economical pressure on the West by means of a prolonged proxy war, could be one of his the actual goals...but it only works as long as West is using Ukraine as a proxy to test their new toys ...legally.\\n\\nWhy Ukraine? Well that just happens to be a country that cannot trigger a WW3 as soon as you attack em...\\n In a way Finland could have been Ukraine just as well, as we have neo nazis here too, just like in America also in power positions(according to tabloids of the past). I\\'m guessing that \"denazification\" is one of the reasons why Finland decided about NATO membership so quickly :D but seriously, there are better ways to deal with misguided people than a war.\\nAttack started to the west, and Russia had only two choices there, after a quick googlin I found out that there is only few differences that matter between two countries, Finland mainly exports machinery and shitting paper, while Ukraine exports food in significant enough quantities. Attack on Finland would simply not have same effect on the West, because people can live without Finnish machinery and shitting paper, but not without food...\\n\\n...hmmm this is starting to make sense.

Why and how would there be a widescale insurgency in the eastern part of Ukraine, given that it's ninety percent ethnic Russian? I don't think the analogy with partisans in WW2 makes sense at all. I could be wrong.\\n\\n2. I don't think the Russians ever intended to occupy Kiev. My understanding was they surrounded it, except to the west, to keep Ukrainian forces locked down and unavailable further east. Occupying a city of that size in the year 2022 would cost blood and bad optics, I don't see many modern armies wanting to do that. I could be wrong.\\n\\n3. In terms of institutional and monetary pressure, I am surprised to see the Ruble at higher prices than what it was against many major currencies than before the war. I think Kotkin is correct on some of the tech transfers and blocking of exports in the mid-term causing issues with the Russian economy though. But it seems clear the Russians prepared to some degree for the immediate pressure they would feel. I could be wrong.\\n\\n4. I have never even heard of the idea of a combined counter-attack by Ukrainian forces in the summer. The idea somehow the heavy weaponry is going to make a huge difference that late in the game seems unlikely to me but maybe I'm wrong. It also assumes the bulk of it isn't destroyed in transit and that the Ukrainians have the training to use it.\\n\\n5.

The two cases are completely alien to one another and comparing a criminal case to realpolitik in international law (and geopolitics) as a moral conundrum that needs to be compared apples to apples is plain laughable. Theres a reason law is segregated into different spheres/sections and it is not applied equally in every section, let alone every nation. The whole point of realpolitik and realism is that nations do not act on moral principles but on geopolitical and material interests. And that those nations will sometimes go to extreme lengths to justify those actions and/or what they consider to be vital interests. This is what Mearsheimer and Stone are saying, not that there shouldn't be a moral discussion about how nations act, simply that there is no such (or that it is secondary) discussion when nations form their politics that guard their national interests.\\n\\nThis comparison that he made is similar  to how economists try to tell people that a nation's economy needs to be kept tidy like that of a household economy. Omitting naturally the fact that there are completely different circumstances and capabilities for the nation compared to the household (for instance a nation can print money, a household can not).\\n\\nAs for nations signing agreements and then not following those charters or agreements to the letter: yes that is truly unfortunate, but that is simply how nations behave. All nations do this,\\nincluding his own. It is simply and infortunately the world we live in.

I wonder what a judge would think about this type of logic? \"No acquittals on my watch\" - says Kotkin - \"and say goodbye to extenuating circumstances\".

There is no jury and no prosecutor in geopolitics. Ultimately, Oliver Stone has a wiser position, since he actually explained the reasons and interests. While Stephen just pushing current media narrative: Putin might be delusional, Russia is bad, blame Russia. Go ahead and blame all you want, this won\\'t help you get any wiser. I mean, do you really expect some actual expertise from a guy who just said (15:08) that \"Navalny is the second most important person in Russia\".\\n\\nPS: Later he goes on and mentions bunch of treaties ignoring the fact that US backed coup in Ukraine in 2014 was a direct violation of them aswell.

It affects history which creates culture. And culture isn't some abstract essentialism. It's a storehouse of encoded experience.  Which affects and probably even creates emotions. You still make choices, but fear and humiliation can easily and perhaps always overwhelm rationality and cost-benefit analysis.  Kotkin missed the core of his hedge fund saying. Investing is about managing fear and greed.  Few do it well.\\n*\\nKotkin acts like fear isn't real. Just because I ought to be able to walk in a crime ridden area at night, doesn't mean I should do it. And certainly not without paying attention.  Or assuming everyone is law-abiding. Assume guns are loaded and snakes are dangerous.  Heuristics, not law or logic. \\n\\nThere's a relevant example between two species of squirrels. One buries their food for the winter in one place.
